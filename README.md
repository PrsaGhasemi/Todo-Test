# Todo-Test
simple todo website built with nodejs and express js and ejs with html/css interface using EJS
it uses EJS view engine and also i used bootstrap-v4 classes for a more beautiful experience. i also used class and constructors instead of a
data base for faster runtime. the way it works is so simple, add your daily task and when it's done you can mark it as a completed task! and
you can also delete any task you want
